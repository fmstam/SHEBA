# Sheba: a by-product image processing package developed during my PhD


The main idea behind it is to teat everything as a plugin. Therefore, we can realize image processing tasks into pipelines easily.

This high modulation allows each plugin to be engieered seperatly and be pluged in to the system. This increases the effeciencey of the system and reduce the maintenace.

The next step was to create a GUI such that the user can create pipelines graphically and compile them.

I used this package in some of my applications and publications, I found it myself very helpful, I could not not maintain it since I have switched to python where it already has many nice packages, but for any Java application that requires image processing this can be helpful.

> It has some examples on how to use and create a plugin, pipleline, and filters.
