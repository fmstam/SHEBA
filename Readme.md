# Sheba: a by-product image processing package developed during my PhD


The main idea behind it is to teat everything as a plugin. Therefore, these can loaded as necessary, which allows us to create pipelines easily.

This high modulation allows each plugin to be engieered seperatly and be pluged in to the system. This increase the effeciencey of the system and reduce maintenace problems.

The next step was to create a GUI such that the user can create pipelines graphically and compile them on a specific problem.

I used this package in some of my applications and publications, I found it myself very helpful, I could not not maintain it since I have switched to python where it already has very nice packages, but for any Java application this can be helpful to build a core package.

> It has some examples on how to use and create a plugin, pipleline, or even filters.
